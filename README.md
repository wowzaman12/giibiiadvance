giibiiadvance
=============

a continuation of the giibii advance gba emulator

Compatibility right now isn't high, and GB/SGB emulation was stripped from this version.

Todo List
=========
* ~~remove SGB/GB and decouple WIN32 Frontend making it gba only~~
* Add libretro interface
* Design a complete new cross platform interface (prefferably wxwidgets based)
